### Site Goals
The site is aimed at helping restaurant staff to easily manage the menus displayed on the website, as welll as keep track of upcoming bookings, editing and deleting as and when necessary. The site also aims to provide customers with a simple, hassle free way to make reservations, without the need to call the restaurant.

### Agile Planning
This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental steps. The project was assigned to epics, prioritized under the labels, 'Musrt-have', 'Should-have', and 'Could-have'.
Must-have user stories were completed first, then "Should-haves" and finally "Could-haves". It was done this way to ensure that all major requirements were completed first to give the project a complete feel, and then later nice to have features can be added if there is availabilty of time and capacity.
