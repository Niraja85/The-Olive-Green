<hr>

**Footer**

Testing was performed on the footer links by clicking the font awesome icons and ensuring that the facebook icon opened facebook in a new tab and the twitter icon opened twitter in a new tab. These behaved as expected.

## Negative Testing

Tests were performed on the create booking to ensure that:

1. A customer cannot book a date in the past
2. Forms cannot be submitted when required fields are empty.

## Unit Testing

Due to time constraints, automated testing was not implemented. However, extensive manual testing was performed across key user journeys such as booking reservations, navigating the menu, user authentication, and error handling to ensure reliable functionality and smooth user experience.

## Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed.

## Validator Testing

All pages were run through the [w3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). Initially there were some errors due to stray script tags, misuse of headings within spans and some unclosed elements. All of these issues were corrected and all pages passed validation.

Due to the django templating language code used in the HTML files, these could not be copy and pasted into the validator and due to the secured views, pages with login required or a secured view cannot be validated by direct URI. To test the validation on the files, open the page to validate, right click and view page source. Paste the raw html code into the validator as this will be only the HTML rendered code.

![HTML Validator]()

All pages were run through the official [Pep8ci](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) validator to ensure all code was pep8 compliant. Some errors were shown due to no newline at end of file and missing white space after. All of these errors were resolved but still showing in validator.

In settings.py file - The django auto generated code for AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS were showing up as lines too long. I could not find a way to split these lines but since they were auto generated and not my own custom code, I hope this is acceptable.
![PEP8ci]()

JavaScript code was run through [JSHINT](https://jshint.com) javascript validator.

![JS validator]()

CSS code was run through [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/) CSS validator.

## Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design on Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Opera browsers.

Steps to test:

- Open browser and navigate to [The Olive Green](https://the-olive-green-c9c6086e4cc3.herokuapp.com/)
- Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
- Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
- Set the zoom to 50%
-  Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched. No horizontal scroll is present. No elements overlap.

Actual:

Website behaved as expected.
